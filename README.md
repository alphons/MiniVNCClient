# MiniVNCClient - A simple small VNC Client

This is a very simple VNC Client, wrote in C# and not entirely ready yet, although it's very functional. You can see how to use it in a WPF Example, but I use it in a Windows Service project, so it's very versatile and portable. I tried to keep the dependencies to a minimum, and go as far as I can to a generic and agnostic of image format project.

It's not finished yet, but it fits my needs of having a framebuffer to take regular screenshots of a VNC screen.

Enjoy it, and contribute if you want.
